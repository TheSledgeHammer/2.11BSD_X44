A General todo list. Don't hesitate to add to this list. :)

# TODO:
## Compiler:
### Tools:
			
### Kernel:
- Building Kernel/Arch:
	- Compile Issues/Errors:
		- Linker: None atm, Yay! :)
		- Compiler: None atm, Yay! :)

### Documentation:
- Manpages:
	- Severely lacking current information
	OR
	- Missing entirely

# usr/ (User & OS Libraries):
## Contrib:
- GNU:
	- GCC:
		- libstdc++-v3 & libsupc++: (Disabled)
			- Compiler error with vterminate.cc. (Fixed: see commit dc710b2)
				- Caused by stdio.h line 157. 
					define FILE struct __siobuf
			- Keeping Disabled: (Low Priority)
				- Missing a fairly large portion of libc requirements.
				- With 2.11BSD_X44 not requiring c++. These libc additions are 
				unlikely to be incorporated in the immediate future.
- Libarchive: (Disabled)
	- Issues with statfs. (Probably a config thing!)
 	- 2.11_X44 lacks support without numerous quick fixes (hacks). That will most likely be fixed in due time. 
- XZ: (Disabled)
	- Linker compiler time issue: Not finding symbols
 		- liblzma_pic.a(stream_encoder_mt.pico):(.text+0x2b7): undefined reference to `pthread_join'
   		- liblzma_pic.a(stream_encoder_mt.pico):(.text+0xd4e): undefined reference to `pthread_create'
 		- liblzma_pic.a(lzma_decoder.pico): in function `.L400': lzma_decoder.c:(.text+0x2b9a): undefined reference to `memmove'
   		- liblzma_pic.a(lz_encoder.pico): in function `.L11': lz_encoder.c:(.text+0x4ab): undefined reference to `memmove'
     - Currently points to an xz compatability issue, with this issue not showing it's face elsewhere.
     	- Though should be interesting if it does present itself later on.
     - Due to xz not being esstential, it's requirement in the toolchain and dependents have become optional.

## lib:
- libc:
	- softfloat: add to libc
	- stdio: improve support
 		- wide characters.

## libexec:
- add:
	- Network:
		- rbootd, rexecd, rlogind, rshd, telnetd

## sbin:
- add: More critical software
	- Generic:
	- Filesystem:
	- Network:
		- startslip

## share:
- doc:
	- Improve organization of directories and folders for both new and old documentation.
 		- Still allowing old to be accessible. Especially the still relavent stuff.
   	- Compiling: Currently only the new stuff is compiled.
   		- This would require going through the various makefiles and applying fixes.
   	
## tools:

## stand:
- boot:
	- setup configuration settings for elf & non-elf based kernels
	- add: lua interpreter support
	- efi:
		- update missing.
		- needs acpica.

## usr.bin:
- Ar (2.11BSD): Do not recommend using.
- Tar (2.11BSD): Do not recommend using. 
	- Produces segmentation faults and memory buffer overflows. When appending, creating and extracting .tar archives with
	any sort of contents.
	- Can deal with empty .tar archives though. :)
- Add: More critical software
	- Generic:
		- calendar, tr
	- Filesystem:
		- quota
	- Network:
		- rlogin, rs, rsh, ruptime, rwho, telnet

## usr.lib:
- add:
	- Network:
		- libtelnet

## usr.sbin:
- pstat: add proc and usr stats
- mkpasswd: ndbm (4.4BSD/NetBSD) is not fully compatible.
	- Still relies on dbm_pagfno from 2.11BSD's ndbm
- add: More critical software
	- Generic:
		- amd, eeprom, kgmon, syslog
	- Filesystem:
		- edquota, quot, quotaon, repquota
	- Network:
		- altq, inetd, rwhod, trpt, trsp

# usr/sys/ (Kernel):
## conf:
- Seperate file for conf options

## ddb:

## kern:
- subr_hints.c: It's usefulness is in question...
- replace use of spl with something more like DragonflyBSD's lwkt tokens.
- RLimit (Minor Issue)
	- 4.4BSD-Lite2 & 2.11BSD conflict.
	- init_main.c: plimit pointer to rlimit and user pointer to rlimit
	
## arch:
- create seperate options file for each arch
- i386/x86: (Merged under i386)
	- pnpbios: add devices
	- softintr: add feature to smart select soft-interrupts over hardware based interrupts instead of using "__HAVE_GENERIC_SOFT_INTERRUPTS"

## devel: (planned)
- Code planned for future integration
- update copyright headers
- See devel folder: README.md
	- AdvVM: 
		- add a device mapper, use NetBSD's dm as reference.
	- HTBC: 
		- Redo: implements only the blockchain and caching.
		- Logging/Journal functions are filesystem dependent
	- Overlays: pmap's and map improvements
	- Threads: add workqueues and threadpools into kernel

## dev:
- usb (Disabled): Has several compiler errors.
- core:
	
- Improve directory structure
- Essential Drivers
	- To Support:
		- USB: Fix compiler errors and add xhci
		- ACPI: To implement

## fs:
- add UDF support

## lib:
- libsa:
	- Add bzipfs, gzipfs, pkgfs, splitfs
- libkern:
- tekken:
	- Support FreeBSD's tekken library?
	- Better Terminal Emulation support.
		- Could work with wscons

## miscfs:
- NFS: Update Me, I'm not working yet!!

## net / net80211 / netinet / netinet6 / netipsec / netkey / netns :
		
## ufs:
- implement Extended Attributes
- lfs:
	- update lfs structures for 64-bit. Some still only 32-Bit
	- improve logging facilities (see: NetBSD)
	- snapshots? 
- ufs:
	- journaling: softupdates + revised htbc
	- dirhash
- ufs211:
   	- fix quotas
- ufml:
	- adds User library.
	- improve fs support
	- add fs-based routines

## vm:
- Pseudo-Segment: take over of the vmspace stack management.
	- Fixing grow to work with pseudo-segmentation or providing a temporary solution.

## Other:
- Memory Segmentation (Software):
	- Seperate Process Segments: text, data, stack
	- Seperate Instruction & Data Spaces
