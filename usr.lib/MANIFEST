Notes
-----
libm/	We haven't made any effort to convert the new math library for
	the PDP-11 yet (if it's even possible).  If anyone does it for
	us, PLEASE #ifdef your changes on "pdp11".  A PDP support
	subdirectory would be nice too ...  In any case, till that
	happens (sic), 2.11BSD uses libom and hides that fact from
	applications by linking libm.a to libom.a in /usr/lib.

The directorie PORT is somewhat special.  It contains source from the 4.3
that should probably be ported to 2.11 as soon as someone has the time
and inclination to do so.
